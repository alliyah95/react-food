# ReactFood

This was a project I made for [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). It covers the following topics:

-   Basic hooks
    -   `useState`
    -   `useEffect`
    -   `useReducer`
    -   `useContext`
-   Error handling
-   Sending HTTP requests
